# ProgrammingAssignment1
A programming assignment in Visual Basic used to select a button that would show a label with the french translation.

### Project name: Programming A1 - French Numbers 
### Student name: Trinity Thomas 
### Development Tools: Visual Studio 2022
### Issues Encountered: 
* I was overthinking the code.  
  My initial code was to make mulitple labels and have them overlap each other.  
  Luckly, I had alotted a good amount of time to find out the text option that allows you to modify the label.
* I didn't utilize with my resources enough.   
  Visual basic has terms that are weird looking to me. If I had played with visual basic a little more, I would have been more familiar with the items.    
  The book, to me, can be a little repetitive. This is nice because it allows you to understand, but can be a little boring. Utilizing the book for this code made a huge difference and gave me more confidence while writing my code.  
  Playing around with the code is fun too. The IntelliSense helps to show other things I can use.    

#### Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this assignment. I feel alot more confident in Visual Basic and cannot wait to do more!
